Website:
Will need backend proxy server to handle POST and GET requests (because of CORS)
This means we will have to handle passwords in plaintext
It is not possible to obtain the user's existing cookies
We will instead have to generate our own session ID
Therefore the user will be logged out of their browser session when they log in to the website (and vice-versa)
More accessible, faster to access and can also be used on phones

Desktop App:
The POST and GET requests can be handled client side, meaning no backend server and no plaintext passwords :)
We could potentially decrypt the cookies file and use the user's existing cookies, this is shady though possible
The user will still be logged in within their browser (provided they were logged in recently)
Won't need to enter login details as often
